# Cat-Image-Generator
Python code to randomize and compile different images into one randomized cat icon.

Each icon pulls randomly from 8 variations on six total layers: background color, base, eyes, mouth, nose, and accessory. the image is then combined into a unique 96x96 pixel art image. The code compresses the image, assigns it a unique file name, then saves it to a specified directory. 10 randomly generated icons are generated at a time.  

This project was done to emulate the process of NFT image generation, without NFTs/blockchain being involved. All code and icons made with this processor are free to use.
